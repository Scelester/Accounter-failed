# Accounter-failed
app created using Python tkinter 

This is one of the first python project i created using tkinter to help manage accounts, as a replacent for excel.

This used to work in windows but then i had re-edited it in linux machine so prolly need to tweak it a little before 
using in windows.

It can :-
  - create new account 
  - search for names
  - see(goto) details of one person in 1 page(subsection).
  - import data from excel
  - check for errors
  - see total number of account by name (filters the same accout and show exact number of accounts)
  
  
__Short_cut keys for search bar:__


		`..e`    :  check for math errors in accounts
		`..an`   :	 show total number of with account name.
		`..n`    :  show total number of acounts without account name.
		`..madd` :  open export from excel dialog box.

Other shortCuts:__
		`ctrl+ s`    : to enter or exit search bar
		`ctrl+a`    : to add new accounts
		`ctrl + x`  : destroy new account creation frame
